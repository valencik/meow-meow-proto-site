    <h1 id="confronting-racism" class="title">Confronting Racism</h1>
    <p>In the wake of unrest in the United States and elsewhere following the
    deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless
    others, it is important for us to consider the impact of racism in
    every sector of our lives. This includes taking a long, hard look at
    race and racism in our community</p>
    <p>In this blog post, I want to discuss the problem briefly and then
    begin to look at ways that individuals and organizations can learn
    about racism and to make changes to improve diversity, equity, and
    inclusion.</p>
    
    <h3 id="the-problem" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#the-problem"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>The Problem</h3>
    <p>The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
    produced a
    <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech">report</a>
    showing some sobering statistics about the employment of African
    Americans in the technology sector. In the private industry overall,
    African Americans represented 14.4 percent of the workforce, but in
    the technology sector that number was just 7.4 percent. For
    comparison, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218">recent census
    data</a>,
    black or African Americans make up approximately 13.4 percent of the
    U.S. population. The problem becomes even worse at the executive
    level: African Americans fill between 2 and 5.3 percent of executive
    roles in technology firms.</p>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24926/chapter/14#183">2016 commissioned
    paper</a> produced by the
    U.S. National Academies of Science found that African American and
    Hispanic people were not underrepresented in terms of computer science
    degrees (about 9.2%), but that they were underrepresented in the labor
    force (only 5.9%). That study did not address the cause of the
    disparity - we are left to speculate if they encountered bias in
    hiring and interviewing, hostile work environments, or something else.</p>
    <p>Also in 2016, the Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/if-theres-only-one-woman-in-your-candidate-pool-theres-statistically-no-chance-shell-be-hired">reported on a
    study</a>
    on bias in hiring. Their findings showed that when choosing between
    three candidates for a position, people tended to choose a black
    candidate only if the candidate pool had at least 2 black candidates.
    It is worth noting that the effect was the same for gender - a
    candidate pool of two men and one women virtually always resulted in
    committees recommending a man.</p>
    <p>If we are honest with ourselves, these statistics, while sobering,
    should not really surprise us. Looking around at our fellow employees,
    open source collaborators, and conference attendees, we know that most
    are white men. With that, the question becomes, how do we begin to
    confront the racism that appears endemic in our industry?</p>
    
    <h3 id="what-can-we-do" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#what-can-we-do"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>What Can We Do?</h3>
    
    <h4 id="workplace-culture" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#workplace-culture"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>Workplace culture</h4>
    <p>In May, 2020, the Harvard Business Review issued a
    <a href="https://www.umass.edu/employmentequity/what-works-evidence-based-ideas-increase-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-workplace">report</a>
    titled &quot;What Works? Evidence-Based Ideas to Increase Diversity,
    Equity, and Inclusion in the Workplace&quot;. One of the authors, David
    Pedulla, also contributed a
    <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/diversity-and-inclusion-efforts-that-really-work">summary</a>
    which included five strategies for employers to help increase
    diversity. These recommendations can help companies attract, and
    retain diverse talent.</p>
    
    <h4 id="codes-of-conduct" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#codes-of-conduct"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>Codes of Conduct</h4>
    <p>Typelevel has a <a href="https://typelevel.org/code-of-conduct.html">code of
    conduct</a> that emphasizes
    the goal of making the community &quot;friendly, safe and welcoming&quot; for
    everyone. It prohibits harassment based on (among other things) race
    or ethnicity. If you are a member of an underrepresented minority and
    feel that anyone in the community is making you feel unwelcome, report
    it.</p>
    <p>Familiarize yourself with the codes of conduct in whatever
    organizations, meetings, or events you participate in. Taking time to
    digest these in advance will help guide your behavior but also to
    recognize when others may be out of line, and help you understand what
    steps you can take. If your professional or avocational circles don&#39;t
    have a code of conduct, you can begin discussions to find one that
    will suit the community.</p>
    
    <h4 id="intervention" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#intervention"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>Intervention</h4>
    <p>However, it must not fall to people of color to recognize and report
    harassment or unwelcome behavior. As members of a positive and
    welcoming community, we must not be passive bystanders. Learning to
    intervene constructively may take some practice.</p>
    <p>Robin DiAngelo has a list of <a href="https://robindiangelo.com/resources/attachment/silence-breakers-for-whites/">Silence Breakers for Whites in
    Cross-racial
    Discussions</a>
    containing 18 different phrases you can use to intervene directly in
    an ongoing situation. These phrases can help diffuse a difficult
    situation calmly and allow people to save face and, ideally, replace a
    harmful discussion with a constructive one.</p>
    <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center has also produced some useful
    <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20171005/splc-campus-guide-bystander-intervention">suggestions</a>
    for bystander intervention. Although their document was intended for
    use on college campuses, the suggestions may be more broadly
    applicable. For instance, the SPLC points out that even if you do not
    intervene in the moment, you can document harassing behavior and
    provide it to moderators or authorities. In addition, they suggest
    that you can provide support to victims even after harassment has
    taken place.</p>
    <p>When you think about intervening, consider the feelings of the people
    you are hoping to protect. You may wish to discretely ask if they
    would like help in a situation, if there is time or a private channel
    available, especially if you intend to notify a moderator or
    supervisor.</p>
    
    <h4 id="education" class="section"><a class="anchor-link" href="#education"><code class="fas fa-link fa-sm"></code></a>Education</h4>
    <p>Those of us who are in the (white) majority owe it to ourselves to
    learn about race, racism, and the dark history behind them. We should
    also take time to reflect on our role in perpetuating racist power
    structures, and how we benefit from the repression of others. Today
    there is no shortage of books and resources to help us. Here are a few
    commonly-cited resources:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>In addition, we need to look around our own communities for
    opportunities to volunteer or contribute. If you cannot march,
    consider donating to organizations supporting the Black Lives Matter
    movement or to bail funds.</p>
