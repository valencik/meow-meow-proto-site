## About the Conference

A day of Typelevel sessions, co-located with [Lambda World](http://www.lambda.world).

At Lambda.World, we planned the first day to be an introduction to kick things off, with different workshops and events. Included in your Lambda World ticket price is the ability enjoy round table discussions and workshops to see, in practice, how the functional programming paradigm works.

We’ll have a Typelevel Unconference during the morning and introductory workshops and a Scala Spree in the afternoon where we’re going to talk and to work on different Open Source projects from the Scala community.

## Venue

This event will take place at the Palacio de Congresos de Cádiz.



## Sponsors

We'd like to thank all our sponsors who are helping to make the conference happen:
